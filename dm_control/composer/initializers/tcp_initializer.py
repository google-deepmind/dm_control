  This initializer calls the RobotArm's internal method to try and set the

  By default the initializer performs rejection sampling in order to avoid
  poses that result in "relevant collisions", which are defined as:

  * Collisions between links of the robot arm
  * Collisions between the arm and the hand
  * Collisions between either the arm or hand and an external body without a
    free joint

        `arm.wrist_site` is used as the TCP site in place of
        `hand.tool_center_point`.
      arm: A `base.RobotArm` instance.
      position: A single fixed Cartesian position, or a `Variation`
        object that generates Cartesian positions. If a fixed sequence of
        positions for multiple props is desired, use
        `variation.deterministic.Sequence`.
      quaternion: (optional) A single fixed unit quaternion, or a
        `composer.Variation` object that generates unit quaternions. If a fixed
        sequence of quaternions for ultiple props is desired, use
        `variation.deterministic.Sequence`.
      ignore_collisions: (optional) If True all collisions are ignored, i.e.
        rejection sampling is disabled.
      max_ik_attempts: (optional) Maximum number of attempts for the inverse
        kinematics solver to find a solution satisfying `target_pos` and
        `target_quat`. These are attempts per rejection sample. If more than
        one attempt is performed, the joint configuration will be randomized
        before the second trial. To avoid randomizing joint positions, set this
        parameter to 1.
      max_rejection_samples (optional): Maximum number of TCP target poses to
        sample while attempting to find a non-colliding configuration. For each
        sampled pose, up to `max_ik_attempts` may be performed in order to find
        an IK solution satisfying this pose.
